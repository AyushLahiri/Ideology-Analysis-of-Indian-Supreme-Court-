# Analyzing Ideology and Emotion: A Textual Examination of Indian Supreme Court Justices
## Project Overview

This  project aims to investigate  trends in ideological diversity among supreme court judges in India, globally as well by the core subject matter of the case, such as business arbitration, constitutional amendments, and religious disputes. By analyzing oral judgments given by judges across all cases they have presided over in a year, we aim to identify latent attributes that closely represent judicial ideology. This study also explores how arguments presented by judges may reveal subconscious ideological leanings, such as sternness or sympathy, which can vary depending on the case context.

Additionally, the study examines the use of emotional versus cognitive language by supreme court justices. As cases become more salient, justices may cater to increasingly relevant non-legal audiences. Given the correlation between emotion and political ideology, this research seeks to determine whether a scaled measure of emotion and cognition is significantly correlated with ideological leanings.

## Project Status

This project is currently in progress. The proposal has been developed, outlining the primary objectives and methodologies to be employed in the research.
